Additional Activities
Practice Pseudocode
In this activity you will write your own pseudocode program to accomplish a simple task.

Step 1: Choose a Task
Choose a simple task to accomplish with your program. You want this to be complex enough to require multiple steps while still being relatively simple to accomplish. Some ideas are:
Walk across a room
Find the difference between two numbers
Determine if a number is even or odd

Step 2: Write the Pseudocode
When writing the code, remember the four guidelines:
The language should be universal.
Limit each line to one task/action.
Capitalize all key words (even if not at the beginning of a sentence).
Indent loops (like if/then statements)
Don't forget to start with 'Start Program' and end with 'End Program'.

Step 3: Test Your Code
After you have written your pseudocode program, put it aside for at least 1 day (more is better).
The act of resting the ideas you have written will help you to edit your work more accurately later.
When you are ready, try to follow your program exactly.
Did you accomplish the task?
If you were not successful in completing the task, trouble shoot your program to find out why.
You have likely left out a small step that seemed logical to you as you were writing the code, but needed to be spelled out to get an accurate program.
If you needed to do any trouble shooting, wait another day or two before testing your code again.
Continue to test until you successfully include all steps required to complete your task.
Alternatively, you can ask someone to attempt to complete your task following your pseudocode precisely.
Troubleshoot as described above.
